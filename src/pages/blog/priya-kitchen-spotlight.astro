## Meet the Heart Behind Bangalore's Most Loved Home Bakery

In the bustling neighborhood of Koramangala, where tech startups and traditional homes exist side by side, there's a kitchen that has become legendary among locals for its **authentic homemade treats** and **custom celebration cakes**. Today, we sit down with **Priya Sharma**, the passionate baker and entrepreneur behind **Priya's Kitchen**, to discover the story behind one of **Bangalore's most beloved home bakeries**.

*This interview was conducted at Priya's home in Koramangala, surrounded by the warm aroma of freshly baked cookies and the gentle hum of her stand mixer—the same one she's used since starting her journey three years ago.*

## The Beginning: From Hobby to Business

**LocalBasket**: Priya, tell us how Priya's Kitchen began. Was baking always a passion for you?

**Priya Sharma**: You know, baking wasn't something I planned to turn into a business. I grew up in a joint family where my grandmother and mother were incredible cooks. Every festival, every celebration, our kitchen was the heart of the home. I learned to bake almost by accident—my daughter wanted a **custom birthday cake** with her favorite cartoon character, and I thought, "How hard could it be?"

*She laughs, gesturing to her well-organized baking station.*

That first cake was... let's say it was made with love but lacked technique! But my daughter's joy when she saw it, and the way our neighbors reacted when they tasted it, made me realize I had something special. That was three years ago.

**LocalBasket**: What was the turning point that made you think, "I could make this a business"?

**Priya**: The turning point came during Diwali 2022. I had made traditional **Karnataka sweets** for our family—you know, **mysore pak**, **holige**, **chiroti**—and I posted pictures on our apartment WhatsApp group. Within hours, I had fifteen orders from neighbors. That's when I realized there was a real demand for **authentic, homemade traditional sweets** that aren't loaded with artificial colors and preservatives.

> "People are hungry for authenticity. In a world full of mass-produced foods, there's something deeply satisfying about creating something with your hands, with love, with recipes that have stories."

## The Recipes: Where Tradition Meets Innovation

**LocalBasket**: Your menu beautifully balances traditional Indian sweets with modern baking. How do you decide what to offer?

**Priya**: My philosophy is simple: if I wouldn't serve it to my own family, I won't sell it. Every recipe either comes from my family's collection or is something I've perfected through months of testing. My **signature chocolate brownies with jaggery** came from trying to make a healthier version for my diabetic father-in-law.

The **traditional items**—like our **festival special laddus** and **homemade pickles**—those recipes are from my grandmother. She passed them down orally, no measurements, just "a handful of this, a pinch of that." I spent months documenting and standardizing them.

**LocalBasket**: What about your fusion creations? How do customers respond to items like "Mysore Pak Cookies"?

**Priya**: *Her eyes light up* Those cookies are my pride! I was experimenting one day, thinking about how to make **mysore pak** more portable for children's lunch boxes. The first batch was too sweet, the second too crumbly, but the third... perfect! Now they're one of my best sellers.

Indian customers love them because they taste familiar yet exciting. Expat customers find them a perfect introduction to traditional flavors. It's about building bridges between cultures through food.

## The Daily Rhythm: Life as a Home Food Entrepreneur

**LocalBasket**: Walk us through a typical day in your kitchen.

**Priya**: I wake up at 5 AM—this is my quiet time before the world wakes up. I start with checking orders that came in overnight, then I prep ingredients. By 6 AM, if I have **custom cakes** to finish, I'm working on those because they need time to set and decorate.

*She shows us her order book, meticulously organized with customer preferences and dietary restrictions noted.*

My children leave for school by 8 AM, and that's when I can really focus. I batch-bake similar items together—all cookies one day, all traditional sweets another. I've learned that efficiency is crucial when you're a one-person operation.

**LocalBasket**: How do you balance being a mother, homemaker, and entrepreneur?

**Priya**: *Pausing thoughtfully* It's not easy, and I won't pretend it is. Some days I'm frosting a wedding cake at midnight because it's the only quiet time I have. But my family has been incredibly supportive. My daughter, who's now 12, is my best quality tester, and my husband handles all the delivery coordination.

The beautiful thing about a **home-based food business** is that I'm still present for my children's important moments. I'm here when they come home from school, I can attend parent-teacher meetings, and during their holidays, they sometimes help with simple tasks like packaging cookies.

## Quality and Authenticity: The Priya's Kitchen Promise

**LocalBasket**: What do you think sets your baked goods apart from commercial bakeries or other home bakers?

**Priya**: Three things: **fresh ingredients**, **personal attention**, and **family recipes**. I source my spices from a shop my mother has trusted for twenty years. My **cardamom** comes directly from farms in Kerala through a family connection. For chocolate, I use only brands I would buy for my own children.

But most importantly, every order gets my complete attention. When someone orders a **birthday cake**, I ask about the birthday person—their age, favorite colors, any dietary restrictions. That cake becomes my canvas for making their celebration special.

> "Commercial bakeries optimize for shelf life and cost. I optimize for taste and the joy on someone's face when they bite into something truly special."

**LocalBasket**: How do you ensure food safety and quality when operating from home?

**Priya**: Food safety is non-negotiable. I have my **FSSAI license**, I maintain separate refrigerators for business use, and I follow strict hygiene protocols. I've taken food safety courses, and I regularly update my knowledge.

*She shows us her dedicated baking area—immaculately clean with industrial-grade equipment.*

Every ingredient is dated when it arrives, I maintain temperature logs for items that need refrigeration, and I have a strict "when in doubt, throw it out" policy. My reputation depends on consistently safe, quality food.

## Customer Relationships: Building Community Through Food

**LocalBasket**: How do you handle customer relationships and feedback?

**Priya**: My customers aren't just customers—they're neighbors, friends, extended family. Mrs. Krishnamurthy from 3B orders the same **filter coffee cookies** every month for her book club. The Sharmas order **sugar-free options** because their father is diabetic. I know their stories, their preferences, their celebrations.

When someone gives feedback—positive or constructive—I listen carefully. Last year, a customer mentioned my **chocolate cake** was too dense. Instead of being defensive, I spent two weeks perfecting a lighter recipe. Now it's even better.

**LocalBasket**: Do you have any particularly memorable customer stories?

**Priya**: *Smiling warmly* Oh, so many! But one that touches my heart—there's a young couple who moved to Bangalore from Kerala. The wife was homesick and missing her grandmother's **coconut burfi**. She asked if I could try to recreate it based on her description.

I spent weeks perfecting the recipe, sending her samples, adjusting based on her feedback. When I finally got it right, she cried when she tasted it. She said it transported her back to her grandmother's kitchen. Now I make it for several Malayali families who heard about it through word of mouth.

## Challenges and Growth: The Real Talk

**LocalBasket**: What are the biggest challenges you've faced as a home food entrepreneur?

**Priya**: Time management is the biggest one. During festival seasons, I sometimes get more orders than I can physically handle. I've had to learn to say no, which is hard when you want to help everyone celebrate.

**Pricing** is another challenge. People sometimes compare my **custom cakes** to mass-produced commercial ones and don't understand why mine cost more. I've had to educate customers about the difference between using real vanilla extract versus artificial flavoring, or fresh butter versus margarine.

*Her expression grows more serious.*

The loneliness can be tough too. Most days, it's just me in the kitchen. I miss the camaraderie of a traditional workplace sometimes.

**LocalBasket**: How do you see Priya's Kitchen growing in the future?

**Priya**: I'm at a crossroads, actually. The demand is there to expand—maybe hire help, maybe rent a commercial space. But I worry about losing the personal touch that makes us special.

For now, I'm focusing on **seasonal specialties** and **baking classes**. I started teaching monthly workshops where I share traditional recipes and techniques. It's wonderful to see other home bakers starting their own journeys.

## Advice for Aspiring Home Food Entrepreneurs

**LocalBasket**: What advice would you give to someone thinking about starting their own home food business?

**Priya**: First, **start small**. Don't quit your day job immediately. Build your skills, build your customer base, understand the business side gradually.

**Invest in quality ingredients and equipment** from the beginning. Your reputation is built one order at a time—one bad experience can damage relationships that took months to build.

**Get proper licenses and insurance**. It shows professionalism and protects both you and your customers.

Most importantly, **be authentic**. Don't try to copy what someone else is doing successfully. Find your unique voice, your signature offerings, your story. Customers connect with authenticity.

**LocalBasket**: Any specific advice for women considering this path?

**Priya**: Don't underestimate yourself. Many of us have been cooking for our families for years—we already have the skills, we just need to believe in ourselves.

**Set boundaries** early. Your kitchen is your workplace during business hours. Family and friends need to understand that just because you work from home doesn't mean you're always available for personal requests.

**Build a support network**. Connect with other home food entrepreneurs. We share challenges, solutions, sometimes even refer customers to each other when we're overbooked.

> "The food business is ultimately about nourishing people, creating joy, building community. If you approach it with that mindset, success will follow."

## The Secret Ingredients: What Makes Priya's Kitchen Special

**LocalBasket**: If you had to identify the "secret ingredients" that make Priya's Kitchen successful, what would they be?

**Priya**: *Thinking carefully* 

**Consistency**—every batch tastes the same as the last. **Care**—I put the same attention into a dozen cookies as I do into a wedding cake. **Community**—I'm not just selling food, I'm participating in people's celebrations and creating memories.

And honestly? **Love**. I know it sounds cliché, but when you're baking at 6 AM for someone's birthday, when you're perfecting a recipe because you want to surprise a regular customer, when you're packaging items with little handwritten notes—that's love. People can taste it.

## Looking Forward: Dreams and Aspirations

**LocalBasket**: Where do you see yourself and Priya's Kitchen in five years?

**Priya**: I dream of having a small café where people can experience **traditional Indian baking** alongside international favorites. Maybe offering **cooking classes** for traditional recipes that are getting lost in the younger generation.

I'd love to mentor other home food entrepreneurs, especially women who want to turn their culinary skills into businesses. There's room for all of us in this space—each bringing our unique flavors and stories.

**LocalBasket**: What do you hope people take away from your story?

**Priya**: That it's never too late to start something new. That **traditional skills** have value in the modern world. That **small businesses** with personal touches can compete with large commercial operations.

Most importantly, that **food is love made visible**. Every time someone chooses to order from a home baker instead of a chain store, they're supporting someone's dream, someone's family, someone's passion.

## Connect with Priya's Kitchen

**LocalBasket**: How can our readers order from Priya's Kitchen or connect with you?

**Priya**: I'm most active on **WhatsApp** and **Instagram**. People can see my latest creations, seasonal specials, and availability on Instagram [@priyaskitchenbangalore](https://instagram.com/priyaskitchenbangalore). For orders, WhatsApp works best because I can discuss customizations and dietary requirements easily.

I also love when customers visit our **LocalBasket profile page** at [/bangalore/food/priyas-kitchen](/bangalore/food/priyas-kitchen) because it shows all our offerings in one place and includes reviews from other customers.

*As our interview concludes, Priya packages some of her signature **mysore pak cookies** for us to take home. The care with which she arranges them in a beautiful box, includes a handwritten note, and ensures they're properly sealed for freshness, exemplifies everything she's shared about her approach to business.*
